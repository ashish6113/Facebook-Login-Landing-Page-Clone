<h1>This is a Facebook homepage Clone.</h1>
Author - Ashish

This project just gives the look a like feel of facebook website homepage. No function in this website will work because it only has a html and css code behind it. This is not a responsive website by which it meant that it will only look best and with proper spacing when the chrome is on 100% zoom (default zoom). Just done this project to learn all about css execpt responsiveness. Any error in this look a like will be fixed on time.
